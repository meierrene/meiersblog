This blog was created using <code>Node.js</code>, <code>EJS</code> and <code>NoSQL</code> based on CRUD's database basic operation from <code>MongoDB</code> using my personal DB cluster. (Fell fre to update it!).
The current features you can:
- Create a post;
- Find the post;
- Delete the post;

In the near Future I'll insert more features updates. Stay tuned!
